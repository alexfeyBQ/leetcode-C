# LeetCode C

Welcome to my LeetCode repository!  

I just started solving problems on LeetCode. This repository is meant to **document my solutions in C**, track my progress, and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure
- `.c` files: each file contains a solution to a LeetCode problem, accompanied by a README that explains the **intuition**, **approach**, and the **method** used in the solution.

## Notes on the `.c` files
- Each `.c` file contains **only the solution function(s)** for the problem.
- They **do not include a `main()` function** or standalone test code.
- To run or test a solution, you need to write your own `main()` or use the LeetCode online judge.


## Goals
- Solve LeetCode problems regularly
- Understand patterns and optimize solutions
- Build a C coding portfolio

## Statistics (manual update)
- Repository started: 2025-11-01
- Problems solved: 6
- Language: C
